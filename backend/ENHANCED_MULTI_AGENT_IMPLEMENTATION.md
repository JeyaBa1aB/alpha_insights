{msg.sender === 'ai' && msg.agent && (
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-1">
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <div className="w-5 h-5 bg-indigo-500 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center">
        <span className="text-xs text-white font-bold">ðŸ¤–</span>
      </div>

    </div>
    {msg.confidence && (
      <span className="text-xs text-gray-500">
        ({Math.round(msg.confidence * 100)}%)
      </span>
    )}
  </div>
)}
```

## Phase 4: Validation and Testing âœ…

2. **test_multi_agent.py** - Live system testing
   - Tests routing to correct agents
   - Validates response quality and brevity
   - Tests multi-agent coordination
   - System health monitoring

### Validation Results
- **Agent Initialization**: âœ… PASSED (7/7 agents)
- **Routing Keywords**: âœ… PASSED (All keywords boost confidence)
- **Multi-Agent Detection**: âœ… PASSED (Complex queries detected)
- **Master Agent Prompt**: âœ… PASSED (New agents included)
- **System Architecture**: âœ… PASSED (8 total agents, memory enabled)
